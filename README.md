# Agency X

**Project Description:** We will be prototyping and building a 1-page app that describes us and showcases the work that we've done together. We will be updating this throughout our fall term to reflect any new work, as well as new tools and techniques that we learn.

**Project Requirements:** Create a single-page application using what we've learned. A couple of paragraphs of text and at least one image or video for each member is also required (at least).

**Designer**: Create the look and feel of the application. Starting mobile first and evolving our design for tablet and desktop. The Designer is in charge of prototyping the application with the tool of their choice (Adobe XP, InVision, etc). The Designer  is responsible for generating HTML and CSS where appropriate and for gathering Web-Ready images as well as any other graphic assets. Your prototype is going to help the developer to create interactive elements and how to access remote data.

**The Designer will be constantly updating their Github branch (while also merging to master when available) while also doing Code Reviews.**

**Developer:** The developer will be creating the repository on Github and creating the Readme File. The developer will be creating the workflow files of which the techniques will be taught as we progress through the term. Setting up the Gulp Workflow, managing dependencies, adding technical spec to the Readme etc. Create custom Javascript components to access an object containing team member data, portfolio data etc. The developer will also work with the designer to develop a lightbox effect to view a larger version of each portfolio piece with relevent information.

**Push the finished files to the repo, continuously merge everything to the master branch and submit the repo link to the FOL dropbox.**
